This project looks at sales data from the Diwali festival to uncover key trends and insights. The first step is cleaning the data to fix any missing or inaccurate values, making sure the dataset is reliable.

The main focus of the analysis is on visualizing trends in different sales categories. This helps identify which categories performed well during Diwali and highlights seasonal patterns, revealing consumer preferences and potential growth areas.

Visualizations, created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, are essential in this process. They make the trends easy to understand and provide a clear picture of Diwali sales.
